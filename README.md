# Color-Based-Object-Detection-and-Interactive-Game-Development

This project, completed as part of a Masterâ€™s-level Computer Vision module, involves implementing custom image filters, a color-based object detection function, and an interactive "brick racing game." In the first part, filters commonly used in image processing are implemented from scratch, with additional enhancements for detecting objects by color. This functionality is applied in creative tasks, such as an "Invisibility Cloak" effect and "Green Screen" background substitution.

In the second part, a color-tracked "brick racing game" is created, where users control a car to dodge obstacles via real-time color tracking or keyboard input. The game includes enhancements like scoring and speed adjustments. A graphical interface manages all interactions, enabling a smooth, code-free user experience during gameplay.
